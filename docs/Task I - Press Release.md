## RoomLight — Let your guests light their stay their way.

LightBright introduces RoomLight, a hotel‑wide lighting system that gives every guest control over their room’s ambience while providing hotels with a simple way to design and manage lighting across the entire property.  

Hotel lighting solutions rarely cater to individual guest needs. Most hotels rely on one lighting setup for every room, even though guests have very different expectations and preferences. RoomLight moves away from a "one-size-fits-all" approach. RoomLight lets hotels design their lighting plan once and apply it everywhere. Guests can freely adjust their lighting using RoomLight.  

*"We believe that ambience is at the heart of comfort. People feel more at home when they have control over their surroundings. RoomLight lets hotel guests create their ideal atmosphere by controlling room lighting,"* says Lumin Osity, Senior Product Developer at LightBright.  

Getting started with RoomLight is straightforward. Hotels set up their preferred lighting presets, apply them across rooms, and adjust them whenever needed. Updates can be made easily, and the system works property-wide without adding operational burden. Guests can use the intuitive control system to choose the brightness and warmth they prefer.  

*“The results of our hotel guest satisfaction survey have significantly improved since RoomLight was implemented in our rooms. Our guests have especially appreciated the ease of use and complete control over room lighting. RoomLight has lowered the number of room‑related issues we handle and helped us stand out in a competitive market while saving our staff valuable time,”* raves the hotel manager of a 200-room conference hotel in Helsinki.
